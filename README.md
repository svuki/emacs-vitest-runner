# Emacs Vitest Runner

A basic porcelain for vitest. Start this mode with M-x vitest-project. Once running, vitest will watch and rerun relevant tests whenever files change. The vitest output is displayed in a dedicated buffer.

## TODOS

- Running vitest-project twice should open the *vitest* buffer.
- Integrate with el-project.
- Debug random json decoder errors.
